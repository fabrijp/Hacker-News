# Hacker-News
Hacker News App using SwiftUI

I have been challenged to create a mobile application development task consuming an API.

HackerNews (https://news.ycombinator.com/) is a popular social news website focused on computer science and entrepreneurship. 

HackerNews exposes a public API, which is documented here: https://github.com/HackerNews/API



The task was to build a platform native mobile application for iOS which:


● Reads news stories from the HackerNews API

● Presents these stories in descending date order to the user

● Allows the user to view the most highly ranked articles

● Allows the user to launch the link associated with the article in their browser


BONUS


● Quality of code

● Documentation for your project

● The build process for your application

● The testing process for your application

● Demonstrating a platform specific feature (i.e. image picker/persistence)

● Demonstrating familiarity with modern development languages and tools

● Minimize external dependencies


UPDATES #1


● Added bookmark feature

● Improved persistent storage

● Improved UI

● Other small improvements
